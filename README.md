# Election_Analysis
## Purpose
  Tom and Tom's manager, Seth, want to audit the election. We are going to be extracting the results from the excel file and transforming it with python and loading it on Github. We are going to be looking at a few categories for this audit. The total votes, county votes, county with the highest voter turnout, and the winner by popular vote.

## Results
### Votes
It seems that the winner of this election is Diana DeGette by a landslide. The results that we got back is that she won with 73% of the vote. She got over triple the votes of second place, Charles Casper Stockham. The total number of votes that were cast was 369,711.
