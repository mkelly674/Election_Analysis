# Election_Analysis
## Purpose
Tom and Tom's manager, Seth, want to audit the election. We are going to be extracting the results from the excel file and transforming it with python and loading it on Github. We are going to be looking at a few categories for this audit. The total votes, county votes, county with the highest voter turnout, and the winner by popular vote.
